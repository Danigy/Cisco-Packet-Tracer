Janu and her dog left from home in the evening, and were heading to a park.
Janu was angry at her dog: because it played around and broke her spectacles.
The dog kept coming to her with a really sad face, apologizing as he didn't do it wantedly.
Later, Janu left/ behind all her anger and was playing with her dog as usual.
Dog became really happy having his friend around again after she left angry.
They both went out for a walk- around the park.
Finally, they returned back home.
